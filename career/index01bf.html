    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-15">Will there be training and development opportunities in my new role ?</a> 
    <div id="accordion-15" class="accordion-section-content">

    <div class="accordion-section">
    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-17">Will there be opportunities for career progression ?</a> 
    <div id="accordion-17" class="accordion-section-content">
    There are no set career paths. That's because we believe people make the most of their potential when they're free to move in the direction that suits them best. Within a short period, you could be a team leader in your department or managing a large client. You just have to prove you're ready for that step up. Corporate Resources believes the responsibility for career development rests both with the individual and the organization. While the organization provides opportunities for learning and growth, it is the individual's responsibility to ensure he/she enhances his/hers competencies to shoulder higher responsibilities. Career development therefore is a two-way process. Above all, the key factor determining career growth is meritocracy and performance.
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="accordion-section">
    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-18">When I join Corporate Resources, am I recruited for particular Division or flexible between businesses?</a> 
    <div id="accordion-18" class="accordion-section-content">
    You are recruited into Corporate Resources and after your induction you are assigned to a particular Division. Corporate Resources is structured such so as to ensure 'separateness' for focus in each business and integration for synergy. New entrants are assigned to a particular Division where the focus is on understanding that particular business: the market, the product, the process etc. The attempt is to provide cross business exposure to managers with demonstrated potential to enable them develop all round business skills and prepare them for business leadership. Those individuals who prefer to grow as functional specialists are encouraged to do so.

    </div>
    
    <div class="accordion-section">
    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-19">Is age a barrier to career growth in Corporate Resources ?</a> 
    <div id="accordion-19" class="accordion-section-content">
    Not in the least. As already stated, career growth is determined by performance and meritocracy
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="accordion-section">
    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-20">What are the cornerstones of Corporate Resources performance management system?</a> 
    <div id="accordion-20" class="accordion-section-content">
    The cornerstone of the performance management system is the Appraisal System. The individual agrees to performance objectives at the beginning of the year with his/her superiors. These objectives naturally flow from the objectives of the unit/business. At the end of the year the individual's performance is assessed against the objectives set. The appraisal attaches as much importance to ''how'' results were achieved as to the results themselves. The rating is determined by the manager's boss and endorsed by his boss. Therefore, two individuals are involved in assessing a manager's performance.	<br>
    The appraisal process also gives the individual an opportunity to share in a formal manner his/her own career aspirations and what the individual needs from the organization to enhance his/her own development. Based on an assessment of development needs, a development plan is drawn up for each manager.	<br>
    Remuneration changes are made once every year based on the performance rating of the individual. The entire process is transparent and objective.

    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-22">Will I be able to use my language skills?</a>
